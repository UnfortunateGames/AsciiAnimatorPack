## HOW TO USE ASCII ANIMATOR

If you want to animate better but don't wanna leave in and out of a level
then you read the right thing.

Here are THREE simple steps

- Step 1. GET ASCII ANIMATOR
  [AsciiAnimator](https://github.com/thatcherclough/AsciiAnimator)
    You also need to read the ReadMe File or just below the files
    IT IS REQUIRED FOR KNOWLEDGE
- Step 2. I said it once and I'm going to say it again READ THE README FILE
  Summary of the whole ReadMe File is:
    The command to run it is;
      java -jar (Your Downloaded JAR file) - this is your run command
      -f (Your txt file) - This will be your designated frames
      -l BOLEAN - A true or false for looping the frames in the TXT file
      -fps NUMBER - This is REQUIRED to run the animation.
      (If the -f or -fps command is invalid, it will show the help text)
    For exiting, it is simply "CTRL + C"
    
    You NEED to put [frame] in between all the frames
      Example:

        test

        [frame] - Like this.

        test

        [frame] - It also needs an ending [frame] too

Now you know how to animate in ASCII ANIMATOR.

## HOW TO EDIT THE .bat FILE

If you are dumb like me and want to get straight to the .bat file
use the BUILT-IN TEXT EDITOR. It has many uses in this software,
similar to what I'm talking about right now.

- 1. Right Click
- 2. Press "Open With"
- 3. Select "Select other apps" (or just the text editor if available)
- 4. SELECT THE TEXT EDITOR
